        <p>Juan Vazquez III</p>
        <p>"What's that called on the App Store?"</p>
        <p>Juan is a Gen Z technology user. He only knows how to access the digital world through apps on his iPhone, has a
          limited grasp of what a filesystem is and hasn't used a desktop since the computer lab in 8th grade.</p>

        <p>Juan breaks his phone screen, and the app instructs him to give it information that allows it to 
          diagnose that the issue is simply a broken screen protector, which can be replaced easily. The app 
          saved him a trip to a repair shop, and he even might have replaced the phone if not for its guidance.</p>
